| Who | What | When | Where | Why | How |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Caribs | Their diet consisted of mainly seafood | 1000 years before arawaks and still today | Trinidad puerto rico lesser antilles bahamas | They were always chasing the arawaks for food and slaves | Lived in small rectangular house, they slept in hammocks, and amais |
| They were always attacking the arawaks and neighboring tribes | Clubs and stone tools | They needed food or ran and warriors |  | They needed many slaves | They wore nothing except for a loincloth |
| The boyez were their priest and doctor | The boyez fought evil spirits | When anybody became sick | Thy would do rituals in their houses | Because they thought the maboya was angry and needed to appease him | They would use tobacco leaves and smoke usually from tobacco |
| women | Had very practical knowledge of healing | Spent time making things in house and also carried all the loads | Because women were considered more as servants | They lived apart from men in their own house which was half the size of the man's house | If the husband didn't like the woman he would abandon her and if the woman did something against the husband he could club her to death |
| caribs | Canoes made out of burnt out tree trunks | They are moving from island to island or fighting or fishing | Over the ocean | Hunting fishing or moving | In canoes or pirgas a boat that was built of planks and could carry 50 men |
| Great captain | Commanded carib fleet of canoes and pirgas | When the tribe was at war...  always | Had his own pirga and staff to come along | Because he was chosen for life | He commanded from pirga |
| Captued Women | Given to bravest warriors | At ceremony and while at war | Ceremony of victory | Because they are prized as servants |  |
| Oubouto and governors | Laws were few | Wrestling canoe racing singing dancing storytelling | At ceremonies and victory parties | Cause he has the most important | Lots of tobacco and beer. |
