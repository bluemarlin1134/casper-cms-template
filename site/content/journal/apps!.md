So, I was sitting in my chair today, thinking how I got gipped off by using android as my main os. 
#
1. I had no markdown editor that I really liked.
#
2. I had no coding editor that I really liked.
#
3. I lost a bunch of money to the 👹 By having to use google while on this computer.[^1]

So I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "This time I WILL hold off longer!"
Then something called reality comes and slaps me upside the head, and it's like, "*Ehem*, Android happens to  be built around Google, why you can't even uninstall the browser!" 😒 Thanks, Reality.

After doing some searching around, yes I know, on Google, for how to uninstall default apps on , I realized without either a root or some weird update, I would have to leave it on. 

Then I came up with a genius plan. 😆 I'll just disable it! So I run on over to my settings, and hit disable on google, google chrome, I even go and hit disable on Youtube!

Few minutes later, I'm back trying to figure out how to get on any websites now... cuz I realized it's kinda impossible to get on the internet and veiw any websites... hmm...🤔, then I was like, 😲, then, 😳, then 😖, to,🙃, then to 😁, finally 😂! "I'm gonna make an app! No, multiple apps, with all my favorite websites on them so I won't have to use a browser, but will still be able to use the website!" **GENIUS MOMENT**.
# .
ME: "Oh, hi Reality, what are you doing here?"
# .
👤 (Reality): "I'm here to remind you that you barely know how to make an app, and you definetly don't know how to turn a website into one."
# .
ME: "Oh, yeah.." --*crickets in background*-- 

Back to google we go!

So after some searching, I managed to find this website, which blew my mind! All you do is paste the url of the website in, and it converts it into a real android app!

Well, now I have like 15 apps on my computer which are my main websites, which I really don't use much more than that. I am officially browserless! 

##### Okay! That's all for today.
