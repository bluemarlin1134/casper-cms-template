So, I was sitting in my chair today, thinking how I got gipped off by using android as my main os. 
1. I had no markdown editor that I really liked.
2. I had no coding editor that I really liked.
3. I lost a bunch of money to ðŸ‘¹ By having to use google while on this computer.[^1]

So I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "This time I WILL hold off longer!"
Then something called reality comes and slaps me upside the head, and it's like, "*Ehem*, Android happens to  be built around Google, why you can't even uninstall the browser!" ðŸ˜’ Thanks, Reality.

After doing some searching around, yes I know, on Google, for how to uninstall default apps on , I realized without either a root or some weird update, I would have to leave it on. 

Then I came up with a genius plan. ðŸ˜† I'll just disable it! So I run on over to my settings, and hit disable on google, google chrome, I even go and hit disable on Youtube!

Few minutes later, I'm back trying to figure out how to get on any websites now... cuz I realized it's kinda impossible to get on the internet and veiw
