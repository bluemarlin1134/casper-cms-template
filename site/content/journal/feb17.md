Well, today, I went to install puppy linux on my computer... I tturned out <strong>very</strong> badly...
The first thing i did wrong, was I started the install with out understnding the instructions. So after I deleted my partition, my PRIMARY  partition, I couldn't find any where that told you how to install it properly... Then it got nasty.

1. My keyboard stopped working.
2. I was called outside to cut a peice of wood.
3. The computer froze like 6 times.
4. I had to reboot it like 3 times.
5. At this time I was convinced that I was not going to use ubuntu on my laptop for a little while. So I went scouring the web for a good linux distro.
6. Oh did I mention that every os I happen to download, happens not to work on my laptop for some reason or for another?
7. The meanwhile. yep, you guessed it, the internet started acting funny, and moving really slow.
8. I still didn't accomplish the thing I set out to do. 

I started this whole thing trying to install kindle on ubuntu, and I got... I don't wanna talk about it.

### Other that that
I had a great day, and managed to upload some more content here, and are probably going to add some more books on here.

#### Have a great day!
