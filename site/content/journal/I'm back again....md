title: Well.. Im back
---

Okay, so this is what happened to me, i said to myself that i'm not going to switch back from android, and i'm going to stay with it. Heres the problemo. Android x86 has a bug thats not letting the device go to sleep, and my devices battery is geeting killed! Much faster tha it need be, which is just the opposite to what they said it would do! And sure, I thought that having the joy of millions of android apps would override this problem, but if you've only got 6 hours of battery life when you used to have 9 you understand what I mean, there is no time to use any of your android apps!

Now wait you say, why in the world would you need nine hours of battery life on your computer? You can't be on your computer for nine hours a day??? Well yes, but I like to know when I reach for my computer, it will be on and ready for me to use it, and I rarely have to worry if it is dead or not.

So yes... I am back to ubuntu... And i've got my old debian based os back, sure I miss the emojis and even a bit of the novelty, but having android as your main os is something for a desktop computer without the need for a battery.
