### Yay!

So I can't belive I did something really foolish... 
To start from the beginning, I use Linux. So, when I switched from windows to linux, I ended up downloading an app (is it called an app?) called "Magnesium". So I told my brother (don't ask me why) that I would pay him five dollars if Ilistened to anything else other that 21 Pilots and 2 Cellos, which I really recondmend you to listen to 2 Cellos if you havent already. Anyway, well see how my self inflicted torture will progress during the week.

Otherwise I really didn't do much today, didn't get any homework which is great! Well, thats all, I gotta finish building this website. 
### See ya!
