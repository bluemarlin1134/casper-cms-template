title: Morrocco Part 1
---

Now, I will explain to you my so called laptop dillemma. On April 1, a monday, we headed to bergamo airport in Milan. It was a very nice ride. I'm gonna digress here a little bit, BEWARE of italian bus drivers! theese people are nuts! They must keep one hand on the wheeel, and one hand on the horn. One of our bus drivers, the same on that carried us to Milan, one car got infront of his way, and he started yelling, and waving his hands and leaning on the horn... The, funny, i dont know if you wanna call this funny, the rest of the way, he mumbled to himself... ***for two hours***.

Anyway, we had a hangup at the airport, but managed to catch our flight our of bergamo to Marrakech airport. For a while there while flying, the turbulence got really bad, but thankfully we arrived in one piece. We arrived at 10 o'clock, or "half ten" as the guy said when I asked im the time, and my first thoughts about Morrocco: *"Boy! It is cold!"* Later I realized that the weather in Morrcco just can't make up it's mind. It's cold one minute, and the next minute your'e reaching for your scarf and jacket. It is really strange... 

At immigration, they only take you one by one, so Moshe and I had to get in a different line, which obviously disturbed Mom, but the guy was really nice, and gave me absolutely no problem. Now this is where we get started.

Driving is not one of Morrocco's specialties. I heard a rumor that people there are supposed to drive on the right side of the road, but they drive at any speed, and on any side that pleases them. It is hard to explain how bad it is... Our first experience of this was when we stepped out of the airport. Mom asked directions to the Riad Kech our hotel... which we found out no on ever had heard of it... the guy though he would take us to it... he took us to the wrong one... and told us it would be **150 DIRHAM!!!**
