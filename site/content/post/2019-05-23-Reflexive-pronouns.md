## Reflexive Pronouns

| personal  | me     | us        | you      | it     |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| reflexive | myself | ourselves | yourself | itself |

No reflexive pronouns can be a subject except for "it" and "you".

- you can only use reflexive pronouns when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same thing

> Janelle made herself breakfast.

 &uparrow; Janelle is herself so herself is reflexive.
 
> Janelle mad us breakfast.

&uparrow; Janelle is not us, so us is not relfexive.
