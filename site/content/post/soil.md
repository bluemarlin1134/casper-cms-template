[^1]: I really don't know why they make a distinction here, Salt is a mineral. 🤨

> Soil is a layer of rock debris and organic matter.

### Weathering
- physical weathering
    - rock broken up but its chemical composititon does not change
- chemical weathering
    - rock is broken down by chemical change... water is always involved
- biological weathering
    - rock is broken down by tree roots or other biotic elements

### Types of soil
- soil is the direct result of weathering... it is formed when weathered rock combined with hummus
- Hummus is decayed organic matter (plant and animal)
- soil hummus
    - essential source of:
        - water 💧
        - minerals 
        - salts[^1] 
- clay soil
    - trees and shrubs grow well
    - vegetables to not grow well (roots can not penetrate)
    - nutrient rich and retain moisture
    - tend to be very alkaline
- loams
    - ideal for agriculture
    - it has:
        - clay to retain moisture 👍
        - sand to ensure good graining and aeration 👍
        - sitacts as an adhesive 👍
- sand soil
    - well drained and aerated
    - roots can penetrate easily but...
        - they are deficient in hummus and...
            - need lots of fertilizers and nutrients which...
                - wash away easily
> erosion is the product of moving one product of weathering to another place...

### soil pH
- depends on the type of rock the soil came from
- soils formed in limestone
    - very alkaline
- soils formed in granite
    - very acidic
- hummus is sometimes added to soil to lower pH
- growth of the plant is affected by pH
- low pH soils ie. ph 4
    - peat, low oxygen, rich in iron minerals, rotting vegetation
