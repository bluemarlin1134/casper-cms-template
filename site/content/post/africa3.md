title: Morocco part 3
---

#### I will begin where I left off.

The man invited us up into the building that he was standing by and for the fourth time that morning, we walked up another flight of stairs. (They don't seem to end in Morocco.) We arrived in the attic, which is the storehouse for some of the dresses that they sell downstairs. Anyway, the guy introduces us to his boss and leaves. I didn't get the guys name sadly, even though we spent so long with him. (Wait, I'm getting to it!) In the back of the room, there was a desk with a few chairs and a couch. We sat down, and the guy began to show us how the tour would go.

1. You set off around eight or nine to reach the Atlas mountains
2. You get a traditional breakfast with traditional Berber women in a traditional Berber house... traditionally.
3. You go to the amazing waterfalls and go swimming. 
4. You get out, dont dry yourself yet though because...
5. You get lunch which is served on tables in the middle of a stream!
6. You can ride camels... or just sit around until...
7. You go home.

Now except for number 3, because I don't like swimming with other people, this sounded pretty good! What sounded even better, was he said we could skip this all, and just go ATV riding in the desert. But of course he was not doing this for free so he brought up price. He said it cost 800 dirham for all of us. Well I don't know if that sounds alot to you, but I almost jumped out of my chair when he said 800 dirham. But again, I forgot the coversion rate, when you do it, it only comes out to about 80 euro, maybe 90 give or take a few dollars. The guy noticed our faces to, or maybe just mine, because he said, we could work something out. I think my brother just about then remembered to convert the money, that he said to mom. "It's only 80  bucks Mom." Well, we said we didn't have it, because we didn't, those people at the Marrakech Herbosterie took it, and we asked him if we could pay 100 dirham now and the rest later.

> "I am sorry, that would not be possible."

Well. There was a little moment of silence before someone said, "Let's try the ATM." So back down the stairs we went to get some cash out the ATM. It didn't work. "Well!" He said "Lets try another one!" So we walked over to the next ATM, come to find out it did not do international cards, and it was just giving us a blank screen. So he said for us to try bank to bank transfers, Mom, wisely said not to, it would make more trouble than good. So he said, lets try another ATM, again it didn't work. So he took us to Marrakech Herbosterie, come to find out the casheir there is his brother, to charge the card for 300 dirham. Again, it didn't work. Instead of giving up, like I would of done by now, he took us to another ATM!  By this time I was talking to mom how we could make a break for it. Well he finaly said, that he would take a deposit of our one hundred dirham, and he would refund us it if the money was not on the card tomorrow. 

Well by the time we were done through all of that, out feet were sore, and it was already past 3 o'clock. But we had nothing to hurry to, except the bathroom, and we had, well only Mom got one, a cup of tea.
