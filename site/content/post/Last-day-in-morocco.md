title: Our last day in Morocco
---

Let me just say one thing: It went fast.

Mom decided lets not get caught up in the souk, and we we still avoiding the main square, so we took a really long and roundabout way to get to a store. Yesterday, Moshe had seen a pair of authentic RayBan sunglasses, and was like, "Oooh! How much?" Come to find out, they were 70 dirham... 7 dollars. Case in point: **If you are looking for cheap, real RayBans, they have them in Morocco for 7 dollars.** So tha morning we went and withdrew some money from the ATM, then we headed over to the store, got the sunglasses, and headed back to the Riad. You see, we were leaving that morning so we had told Mr. Yousef to call a cab. We only had a few minutes to wait until the cab arrived. This cab was so old looking! It musta been from the 1940's, BUT, it was in good condition, and we had a really good ride.

The airport in daylight looks really different! They scan your bags before you can enter the airport. Mom had read horror stories of people who had to stand on that line for hours, but thankfully when we got there, it was only 5 people. We bought some crepes' and we waited.

There is not much to say here, except that the "No smoking" sign was upside down. We boarded our plane, and arrived in Rome about 8 pm.
