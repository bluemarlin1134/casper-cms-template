We woke up that mornig with a firery burning in our minds to do some shopping, but first breakfast. We paid Mr. Yousef 100 dirham a day for breakfast. Before you say: "What!?" (Like I did.) Just remember that it's only 10 dollars. We had decided yesterday to not go on the excursion up to the Atlas mountains, not because we didn't have the money, but because we didn't have enough time. We decided though we would not go and track the man down for our deposit of 100 dirham, being only 10 dollars, and that would add insult to injury by doing that. We decided though that we wouldn't go around that area *just in case* he saw us.

As we were halfway through our breakfast Mr. Yousefs cousin comes over and tells Him that there is a guy downstairs asking for Us! So as the diplomats, Moshe and I walked down the "endless" flight of stairs to the door. Okay, I don't know if this sounds strange to you just picture this: The day before the guy (the tour seller) told us that we would get picked up around 8 am and carried to the bus. So it was around 8 am, and this guy told us we were to get picked up... on a moped?! Now in Morocco it is not uncommon to see up to four and more people on one moped, so I guess it was normal for this guy... but... not happening with us. Either way, we told the guy we wouldn't be traveling anyway so He left.

We eventally got to the souk, and I saw a really nice looking bracelet and I was like oh cool! Because I am a  very picky guy though I asked what it was made of.

> Camel! Yes good! 

He then was like, "Here, try it on!" You know one of those once you have it on you can't take it off and must buy it. I skillfully managed to manouvre my hands into my pocket before he could grab them. Well, well, well, Gotta be more careful next time. All the bags I was looking at cost either too much, or were too small. I was really in no mood to haggle, so the price you gave me was the price I took. The problem is nobody likes to give you a straight answer when you ask for price. They either do a: "What is your price?" Or say "*Around...*" Shopping in the souk in Morocco is not for those who aren't patient. Met this one guy, who invited me into his shop, Mom saved me by telling them I had no money. I did take a picture of him and his store. Just around the corner, I saw this other store (more like shack) and in it was this really old guy. He He had some cool bracelets in the corner they didn't even look like they were for sale. I grabbed one, and asked him how much it was.  10 DIRHAM!!!! Oh... wait, thats only one euro. Okay I can do that. Before I sealed the purchase, I asked what it was made of. The guy didn't speak english so I figured we would have to speak to him in the only other language I am fluent in: Handwaving. Thankfully this lady came over and asked me if I needed any help. 

> Yes! I mean thankyou. Yes, I wanna know, what this bracelet is made of.

"Oh!" She said, "Cow leather."

I bought it.

Just around the corner agi
