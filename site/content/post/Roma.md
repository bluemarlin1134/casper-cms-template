Our flight to Rome was a funny one! When we first boarded our seats were all over the plane, Mom was three rows behind me, and I was sitting a row behind Moshe. Thankfully the plane wasn't exactly full when we took off so naturally people decided to move closer together. I was sitting between a lady and her friend, her friend was sitting next to me, and She was stting next to Moshe. She asked me if I would like to switch seat seats, and of course I said yes. Next was this old Arab guy, who couldn't figure out whose seat was his, and thought I was sitting in it. Meanwhile Mom was doing some "high speed trading" and somehow by the middle of the flight ended up sitting behind me. It wasn't just us that was moving but mostly everyone was out of place. Someone even remarked that the whole plane was playing musical chairs! Other then bumping into a very annoyed guy, nothing extraordinary happened while debarking the plane and going through customs. 

We caught the bus from the terminal to the main bus center called Termini. Dad wanted to take us to the Colloseum but it was kinda dark and we had to get up early in the morning. Because it was raining though I can not say our walk to the hotel was enjoyable. We were going to take a cab, but everyone wanted to charge an extreme amount of money to just go down the road and around the corner (where our hotel was), so we walked. Needless to say the tiring walk with a little bit of jetlag mixed in was the perfect recipe for a good nights rest.

6:00 am greeted us a little too soon for my liking. Dad said:

> We'll wake up reallly early this morning, see the Colloseum, then we would walk back to the Hotel, get something to eat, then walk to the bus.

It **didn't** happen that way... 

Since the hotel we were in wasn't that far away, the immense size  of the Colloseum popped up really fast. They don't tell you this, but when you see the colloseum, there is an entire complex there with temples, arches, and pools. I was so surprised! Dad heard the Arch of Titus was really close as well so we went down the road some more...  the arch was in a compound where they were still excavating, but they allowed tours, it was too early though and we didn't have enough time to wait, so Dad decided to go see the fountains. 

It's kinda funny when asking to find a bus in certain countries. You can ask one person take for example:

you: "Hi, do you speak english?"

they: "Yes a little."

you: "Good! Which bus do I catch to go to the fountains?"

they: "The 822."

So you go to catch the 822, and you see it on a big red sign that says "822". Just to be sure you ask someone else.

you: "Is this the 822 bus stop?"

they: "Oh yes."

You wait around maybe ten minutes and when the bus arrives you ask the driver which stop you get off at. He then tells you:

bus drver: "You have to go to the other side."

If it is not across the road, you have to find someone who knows english, then you have to walk there, (the worst part), then wait around even more!

This is exactly the situattion that we wer in. 

Finally we got to the fountains, after losing some time getting off at the wrong bus stop, and they were really quite nice! But... I don't think you need to have to go to Rome for it.

Now we were **REALLY** in trouble for time because we only had less than an hour to run back to the hotel, get our bags, go to the bus station, taking the train to the other bus station, (which we didn't know where it was) and then we had to get our tickets out... We were running out of time!

I literally ran back to the hotel, we grabbed our bags, grabbed a few packaged pastries, said bye to the manager, and dashed out the door. Now all we had to do was find the hotel. We only had about half an hour now to catch a bus from a stop we didn't know where it was. So we dashed into the metro, and got off where the directions told us to. Franticly with only ten minutes left on the clock wwe dashed from underground and--! 

> Where's the bus!?

So we started asking directions. I asked a buisness man walking down the street, Dad was heading down the road trying to find someone, because the last person we asked didn't speak english, Mom was busy asking people as well. Finally someone gave us some directions to catch our bus. I dashed off in the direction that he pointed. While running I was trying to bring up our tickets. I stopped to ask another person questions, he pointed me in the right direction, I turned a corner, and  *lo and behold* there was our bus! The bus driver thankfully had o problem in bringing up our tickets, and we boarded the bus. That was one of closest calls I have ever had while travelling! We had got to the bus with only a miunute to spare! 

By now you're probably wondering where our bus was going, and why we were in such a rush to catch it. We were going to Venice! And the other reason is because it is a *REALLY* long ride there, and we didn't wanna wind up there in the night, which would of happened if we had of waited for the next bus. That's all for now.

##### Seeya!
