Our flight to Rome was a funny one! When we first boarded our seats were all over the plane, Mom was three rows behind me, and I was sitting a row behind Moshe. Thankfully the plane wasn't exactly full when we took off so naturally people decided to move closer together. I was sitting between a lady and her friend, her friend was sitting next to me, and She was stting next to Moshe. She asked me if I would like to switch seat seats, and of course I said yes. Next was this old Arab guy, who couldn't figure out whose seat was his, and thought I was sitting in it. Meanwhile Mom was doing some "high speed trading" and somehow by the middle of the flight ended up sitting behind me. It wasn't just us that was moving but mostly everyone was out of place. Someone even remarked that the whole plane was playing musical chairs! Other then bumping into a very annoyed guy, nothing extraordinary happened while debarking the plane and going through customs.
