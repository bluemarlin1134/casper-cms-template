😔 Okay, okay! I get your point, I know the background is ugly! I don't like it myself, but it was the best I could dig up! And I know I should use a darker font but I'm working on it!  😁
Well, you managed to find your way here! Which means you also got my letter! Did you set up your blog? I hope you did! So... lets see now, did you read my thing on burps? Now that you brought this to my attention, I have been going around for the past week measuring the decible count on my burps... 🤦. Sorry can't help myself. I've dicovered a new disease that I am severly afflicted with. CBEPD. Compulsive Bad Emoji Putting Disorder. *crickets in background*. Okay, see ya later.
