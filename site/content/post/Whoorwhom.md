#### How to tell if you should use who and whom

##### Who

###### Nomanative case 
do you have a subject
if you have a subject, then use "who".

###### Accusative case 
acting as an object
if you have an object, use "whom".

> This is a very easy way to check as well.

##### Whom

If you can put a "him" in the sentence that sorta makes sense, use "whom".
ie. Whom did we invite?
who did the inviting?
him did the inviting.

##### Who

If you can put "he" in the sentence use "who"
ie. Who are you?
you can answer with, "I am he". [^1]
