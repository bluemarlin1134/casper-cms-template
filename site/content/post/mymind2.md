[^heh]: did you see that?***"when we were young"***

Now I will move to a more pleasant subject. I will now do something I have wanted to do for a little while. I will take my dictionary... No, first I will tell you about my dictionary... no, first I will tell you about my dictoinary because it is a ey special one.

Our library likes new books, so they throw out all the old ones without realizing that the old ones are the best. So I gladly go behind them, and take their book trash... which are usually in really good condition. (It is a library after all...barely) 

About two years ago, I hit the jackpot, and got a 1977 websters dictionary, and it is **HUGE!** It has over 1500 pages, not including the full page maps, diagrams, and a family tree of all the languages. 

Let me get back to what I was saying. So I'm gonna take my dictionary, and randomly pick out a page, and then whatevery my finger lands on first I will see what I know about it.

Well, my finger landed on the word laud. I think it means to exalt or praise. Yep, I was right. It's used in the Bible, particularly in the book of psalms.
When we were young[^heh] Dad would pick words out of the Bible, and if we didn't know the meaning, he would have us write the definition down, and write the definition, and then memorize it... At least that was the idea. After a little whie of looking up the same word over and over again. I realized I didn't have to memorize the definition word for word, and all I really had to remember, was just some key words. Hah hah ha... sneaky me... üòã

Here is something funny. üòÇ

Dad as a project, had us realy the play Julius Ceaser written by Shakespere every morning. As you know it has alot of old english words in it like: "Thee", "thou", "hither", etc. Anyway, we did it for such a long time ‚è≥, that we started using it (more as a joke really) in our daily language... needless to stay, it got stuck. üòí And now it's not uncommon to here me say. ü§† "What art thou doing Moshe, praytell?" and stuff like that. Well, I think I shall derail enough, and move on to the [next letter](post/b/)
