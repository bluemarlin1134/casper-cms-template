title: Morrocco part 2
---

Mr. Yousef, last night had told us that for 3 euros we could have breakfast by him. So, at 9 thirty or 10 we headed back up the stairs to go get breakfast. I have to say, it was *really good*. We had: tea, coffee, this type of bread that is like a tougher crepe, bread, marmalade, cream cheese, a type of cake, and oranges. Pretty good for three euros. We told Mr. Yousef, that our driver last night, offered to take us aroung the city. Mr. Yousef, this became quite a trait, told us that you don't need a driver to go around Marakech, and it is, notice the "safer", "**Safer**, to do it on foot." 

"Well, obviously it is safer to do it on foot", I thought, "how they drive over here, anything is safer than driving!""

Come to find out, walking is just as dangerous.

As soon as we walked out the door we had to pin ourselves up against the wall because of the amount of mopeds comming down the road!

That's a picture of the road that the Riad Kech was on. Mom decided we should go further down the same road and see what was there. While walking through, I saw this guy making leather bags, and purses. I saw one that I thoought would be good to put my computer in, so I asked how much it was. 

Rule 1: Don't assume people know english in Morrocco
Rule 2: Don't be afraid to ask if the person speaks english.

Because I forgot both rules, we ended up in a hand waving match trying to figure out what eachother was saying. Kinda like with Abu Ali in Hebron. The guy finally got his sister who speaks a ***little*** english. 

Now this is was our man problem in Morrocco, when asking a price, don't get scared when the guy says 800 dirham, or a large number like that. You must remember, the conversion rate to euros is **ten to one**. So when the guys sister, says 800, we start trying to figure out if that is dirham or euro. And becuase we didn't know the conversion rate, we ended up, like hebron again, pulling out calculators... in the end we realized the bag cost 80 dollars.

The guys sister, the one who helped us, took us to her restaurant, just on the other side of the street. Now, morroccan food looks good, smells good, but taste **AMAZING!** We decided we wouldn't get anything from her then, but we told her, with of course a little help from our friend google translate, that we would be back around two p.m. to have dinner. So, we headed off down the corner, to find what we we going to find.

Around the corner we met a man selling more bags, leather ones, he told us... acually that's the funny thing, they don't ever tell you a straight price in Morocco, because they expect you to name your own price, and start bartering. We did find out though, that he "expected" (my own words) to get *around* 280 dirham. Now we still didn't get through our heads the exchange rate between dirham and dollar, so again, we freaked out, we at least I did, we we heard that number.

Did I explain my love for the souk? It is like a farmers market on steriods, you can get fruit, nuts, clothing, medicine, fossils, crystals, sunglasses... the thing is, usually you can get things quite cheap, and it is always fun to walk around the souk, because it can literally go on for miles. So we hike off to the souk!
