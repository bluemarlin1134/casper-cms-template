Mr. Yousef, last night had told us that for 3 euros we could have breakfast by him. So, at 9 thirty or 10 we headed back up the stairs to go get breakfast. I have to say, it was *really good*. We had: tea, coffee, this type of bread that is like a tougher crepe, bread, marmalade, cream cheese, a type of cake, and oranges. Pretty good for three euros. We told Mr. Yousef, that our driver last night, offered to take us aroung the city. Mr. Yousef, this became quite a trait, told us that you don't need a driver to go around Marakech, and it is, notice the "safer", "**Safer**, to do it on foot." 

"Well, obviously it is safer to do it on foot", I thought, "how they drive over here, anything is safer than driving!""

Come to find out, walking is just as dangerous.

As soon as we walked out the door we had to pin ourselves up against the wall because of the amount of mopeds comming down the road!
