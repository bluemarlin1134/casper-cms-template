title: I got an average!
---

So Over the pass few weeks, I have been trying to get a proper average of my burps. I know this is going kinda gross but this was all in the name of science! So I think I average around 120 decibels with the mic directly in front of me no more than 5 inches away. I found out that regular fizzy water doesn't do much, pepsi, coca cola, and vita-malt (you've probably never heard that one before, it is a drink made in the Bahamas). To answer your question, on what was my loudest burp ever, with my former experience in sound... I would say around 200 decibels.  

##### Seeya!
