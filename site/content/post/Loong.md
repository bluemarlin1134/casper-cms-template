title: More from Israel
---
##### I have to  catch up on two days with this post, so this might be very long...

So, I will start from the beginning.

When we arrived in Jerusalem, we went to a hotel in the arab side. We had went to it last year, and enjoyed it very much, so we decided to come back. Sadly, now happily, they had no room, so the guy was nice enough to call around, and he booked dad a room at the Colonial Hotel in German Colony in Jerusalem. The hotel was nice, but we go the attic room, so we had to bend our heads everywhere and stoop, so we aptly named it the hobbit room. Needless to say we bumped our heads many times. 

So the next day we found ourselves walking to the old city, and as we were walking there, a cab drives up to us and stops. The man inside honks at us, and we stop. 

"Hello!" He says.

 Now this is the thing you must never do with a middle eastern salesman: You must **never** sound unsure of yourself. And you must **NEVER** say "maybe".
 Once they hear that you might as well hand over your wallet. Now, dad did not sound unsure of himself, neither did he say maybe, but this guy, wus just so... Let me just say this, if he sold cars, this guy would sell you three cars when you just came to *look*. My writing does not do justice to his voice his hand expressions and the speed that he talked at. Just picture the best car salesman youv'e ever met times two.
 
 "Are with a group?" He ask us.
 
 "No." Dad says.
 
 "You see Bethlehem yet?"
 
 Dad answers "no".
 
 "You want to see where the savior was born?" He says.
 
 "Later." Dad says. "I have no money."
 
 "I charge you only 300 shekel."
 
 "No I have no money now." Dad says.
 
"Look!" He reached into his drawer, and pulls out a brochure. "Trip to Bethlehem charge you 78 dollar per person! I charge you 120 dollar."

Dad laughs and says. "I tell you my friend, maybe later, I have no money now!"

He laughs too, and says. "You pay me later!"

Now Dad is no stranger to bargaining, he does it all the time, so now He was in full swing.

"Listen", he said, "I just want to get to the old city, I do not have enough money to pay to go to Bethlehem."

"Fine! No problem!" The Cab driver says, "I carry you to old city, Mount Olives, and Garden of Gethsemane. 70 shekel!"

Dad thought for a while, and accepted the offer.

He first took us to see the Garden of Gethsemane. There they have 8 olive trees that are over 800 years old!
