title: Hebron!

Last night, i had a hard time getting to sleep. I mean I was tired, it's just I couldn't get to sleep! I don't think those 5 arab coffees I had yesterday, and that one americano had anything to do with it though.

Mr Hussein showed up right on time to get his money that we owed him from yesteday from our trip to Bethlehem. When **<*cough*>** he talked Dad into letting him take us on a trip to Hebron.

"It will be good!" He said. "You will get to see the cave of Macpelah, where Abraham, Issac, Yacob, Rebekah, Sarah buried. Then I will tae you to see Rachel tomb as well!"

So that moring we found ourselves on a trip to Hebron. As always, the veiws were amazing. ![](/post/travel/veiw6.JPG)
