title: Hebron!
---

Last night, i had a hard time getting to sleep. I mean I was tired, it's just I couldn't get to sleep! I don't think those 5 arab coffees I had yesterday, and that one americano had anything to do with it though.

Mr Hussein showed up right on time to get his money that we owed him from yesteday from our trip to Bethlehem. The hotel manager gave us free breakfast that morning. That was my forst cup of coffee that day. When **<*cough*>** he talked Dad into letting him take us on a trip to Hebron.

"It will be good!" He said. "You will get to see the cave of Macpelah, where Abraham, Issac, Yacob, Rebekah, Sarah buried. Then I will tae you to see Rachel tomb as well!" So in the end after much deliberation, we acepted.



So that moring we found ourselves on a trip to Hebron. As always, the veiws were amazing. ![](/post/travel/veiw5.JPG). Mr.Hussien first took us to the Avrahim Mosque, because they close at 11 a.m. so that the people can pray. The funny thing is, before you can enter, they make the women cover up with these funny robes.

We saw the tombs of Abraham, Issac, and Rebekah. We had to walk over to the jewish side though. Mr. Hussein Since he is Arab, and Muslim, He couldn't go into the jewish side. The tombs were nice... if you could call it that, and I had a relatively good time. I talked with some Jews who asked me if I wanted a Tephilim to pray, and I was like: "Umm... No, Not really. But thankyou!" Mom came over and saved me in the end, and we had a good chat about the Bahamas.

As dad and I were walking back to the Moslem section we got stoped by the gaurds who were like: 

Guard: "Are you Jewish?"

Dad: "Ummm... Yes."

Guard: "No go!"

Me: "What!?"

Dad: "Well we are kinda half jewish."

We finally told us that our driver was over there, and we are... well, she finally and reluctantly let us pass. Whew!

Mr. Hussein was aiting for us on the other side, to take us to the old city to walk around and shop. Dad got us all freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, and one guy managed to get mom to buy a whole necklace set! I'm telling you, when these Arabs  want you to spend, they get you to!

We then went to a place where they blow glass. And the guy literally mad a vase right there in front of us from scratch!

I ended up buying a fish made from glass... I dont know what possesed me to do it.

Okay, this is where things get funny.

Mr.Hussein's son is having a child, so he wanted to get some things for it. So he asks us f he can stop at the toy shop to see if he can buy it. Dad of course said yes and he said we would go with him. On the way to the store Mr.Hussein met his  friend Abu Ali. (Pay attention to that name because things get interesting.) Abu Ali owns the toy shop. So while Mr.Hussein was shopping I picked up an mp3 player, and asked how much it was. Abu Ali only speaks arabic, so when I asked him how much it was, he said: 

Abu Ali: "Khoreaysh." (Sorry, I know I probably butchered that.)

Me: "Umm... What's that in english?"

So we ended up making a  big scene, fingers start going up, we called people who spoke english, we started counting. His son came over, and had a good laugh at our expense... We ended up finding out that that meant 15... after someone pulled out his calculator on his phone and typed it.
