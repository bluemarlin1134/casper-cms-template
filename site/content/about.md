###  Hi!

I hope you like my website. I built this website to store my Homework, but I branched it out over time.
I like to fly paper airplanes, go sailing, swiming, and hiking.
I live in the Bahamas, and am an avid coder/hacker. I like to share my books that i put on my kindle, so make sure to check out the free books section! Also look below and you might see a few of my articles. 
### Have a good day!
